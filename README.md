# Bible Genealogy Project

Most of us folks who read [the bible](https://www.bible.com/bible) tend to [skip over the genealogies](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/LUK.3.23-38) because our minds tend to wander. As an exercise to pay closer attention to God's word, I thought it could be cool to create a JS object that illustrates the genealogy of mankind according to the bible. ü§î

* Maybe I can add metadata once it shapes up nicely?
* Maybe I can add facts about people or something?

The use cases (if any) are fairly vague now, as is the model of implementation. I'm just messing around to see if I can make something from this.

## Contributing

If you have any ideas for use cases, or have corrections to the historical genealogies according to the bible (it is likely that I've made errors while typing), feel free to [open issues](https://github.com/TejasQ/bible-genealogy-thing/issues/new) or submit [pull request](https://github.com/TejasQ/bible-genealogy-thing/compare)s. üòÅ

## Current Status

So far, I think all of the genealogies up to the [12 tribes of Israel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2049:28) are added. Feel free to make a PR for more stuff if you like.
